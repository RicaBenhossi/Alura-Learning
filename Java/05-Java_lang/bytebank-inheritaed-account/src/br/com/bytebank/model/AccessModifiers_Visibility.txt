Access Modifiers or Visibility

- Public: can be accessed every where
- Protected: can be accessed only by the children class that extends the class mother
- <<Package Private>>: can be accessed only the classes in the same package. 
    There is no keyword to that, so an attribute is considered Package Private when you don't specify any visibility.
    E.g.: 
        private integer id; => private attribute
        integer age;        => package private attribute
- Private: can be accessed only by the proper class.
