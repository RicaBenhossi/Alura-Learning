# Alura-Learning

This repo contains all the notes, codes and exercises of my Alura Courses

Every course has a specific branch. You have to switch to the branch of the course you want to see.
Every change on dockerfile or devcontainer.json should be done on branch Container of the project/language and commited.
After that you must switcht to the course/project branch and CHECKOUT it to the branche (git checkout Container .devcontainer/).
Otherwise, some files can be deleted.
** Every language course must, if possible, have it's own container.
Every change on readme or gitignore files must be done on branch branch_base. After commit it, it must be merged to the project/course branch

## Creating a new Course branch

1. Go to branch MAIN
2. Execute the file "new_corse_branch.sh" on terminal and follow it's instructions.
3. You're done...
